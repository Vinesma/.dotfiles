# .dotfiles

dotfiles are the config files used by applications, some of them are hidden files in folders that start with a dot, thus the name. You can upload them to a repo to manage and backup them for future installs, just like I've done here.

Use the python script in `install/` and select the "Create links" option to link these files to the system outside of a normal install process.

## Install

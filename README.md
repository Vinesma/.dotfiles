# .dotfiles

dotfiles are the config files used by applications, some of them are hidden files in folders that start with a '.', thus the name. You can upload them to a repo to manage and backup them for future installs, just like I've done here.

Use `create-links.sh` to link the config files to this repo. This will ensure the files in your system are updated along with the repo and vice versa.

## Install

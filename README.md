# .dotfiles

Run `createLinks.sh` to link all files to their directories. The directory needs to exist first (i.e. you need the respective application to have run at least once/create them yourself).

## Programs:
A (probably incomplete) list of applications I use, for quick reference in case I do a clean install.

Applications marked with a * can be installed consecutively via the script 'installAllApt.sh'
